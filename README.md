BAE 599: Field Robotics Fall 2020 

## Description
This repository was created to house the robotics.py module.  This module contains all the major functions that were developed and 
used during the Fall 2020 semester of BAE: 599 Field Robotics.  These functions are a good start to any mobile robotics coding that
you plan on doing.  The functions are categorized into multiple uses:<br/>
**Position & Frame Transformation <br/>
Differential Steer<br/>
Ackermann Steer<br/>
Move to Point & Pose<br/>
Path Following: Pursuit & Maneuvers<br/>
Area Coverage**

## How to use
You should save the robotics.py module in your working directory.  Once saved, you can import the module by using a simple import
statement: *import robotics*.  For more concise code, I would use *import robotics as robo*. 

## Dependencies
The functions within robotics.py rely on numpy version 1.18.5 and matplotlib version 3.2.2.  If you are using newer versions of 
these libraries, the functions may not work.
